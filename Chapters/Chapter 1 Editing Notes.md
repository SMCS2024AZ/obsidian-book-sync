General:
* Not sure about humorous tone near beginning
* Abbreviations?

Specific:
* Names are TBD, especially the humanitarian vessel's.
* Celestial vs. maritime?
* It might make more sense of the humanitarian vessel is picked up on sensors, and they're more confused about their situation.  It's kind of farcical for them to be hailing an enemy for assistance with repairs.
