Anton Haught was dressed in loose, informal livery – atypical choices for a member of the aristocracy. Freshly wed with a degree in mathematics and psychology, he was returning to his home planet of Ionad, an expansive, urbanised world of nearly 5 trillion. Of the hundreds of stars in the Free Asiaru Star Systems, Ionad was among the most prosperous, owing primarily to its wealth of resources. 

However, he did not return to Ionad to reminisce, for currently, a debate of exceptional importance held the aristocrats of the Free Asiaru Star System in its grasp - a debate in which Anton Haught was concerned.

Since the genesis of interstellar travel – a long bygone age of humanity - the periphery of the star cluster had been controlled by KyōtoCorp, fastidiously gripping onto their territories. KyōtoCorp was a remnant of the archaic days of humanity, a time before they had ever traversed the stars; the meaning of Corp had been long forgotten, doomed to be lost in the bowels of human history.

An attendant entered the passenger compartment and gave a slight bow to Anton – a formality often reserved for the upper class.

“We’ll be arriving on Ionad shortly.”

Anton glanced upward. “Thank you.”

Luckily, the bureaucratic nature of Anton’s arrival meant they could skip much of the lengthy landing procedure, and begin descent immediately. The descent into Ionad was hardly noticeable; a change in gravitational pull, slight hiss of the hydraulics, and change of scenery were the only indications. Of course, the vessel in question was among the most lavish you could purchase – the product of 6000 years of development. Outside the ship, a sea of cragged metal structures stretched into the distance, occluding the horizon. A grey haze of a sky was visible, imprinted with the shifting traffics.

On the ramp below, a small envoy awaited Anton’s arrival. Their job was likely to make his visit as pleasant as possible – he was a politician, after all. Abhorred as he was by other representatives, he still enjoyed many of the formalities of the upper class.

The papers splayed across Anton’s lap were quickly shuffled and ordered into a briefcase, the face of which had peeled and cracked over years of use. His effects were gathered from his feet, and he made his way toward the egress, depressurizing the ships hull with the twist of a handle. The air was thicker on Ionad, the gravity more intense; of course, his body hadn’t acclimated yet.

A man stepped forward from the group,and took the door handle from Anton. “Mr. Haught,” he drawled, accompanied by a short bow. “We are glad you were willing to travel such a distance, sir.” He outstretched his hand, inviting Anton to return the gesture.

Anton nodded in return, extending his hand in a firm handshake. “I appreciate it.”

“Is there anything you have need of, Mr. Haught?” His face broke into a soft, warm smile.

“No, I’m thankful for your considerations though.”

“Right this way then, sir.” He gestured to a vehicle behind him, opening the door.

The interior of the craft was luxurious to the point of gaudiness; there was a fitted fridge in the door, though it was doubtful their trip would be long enough to make use of it. A dark, rich synthetic fabric was stretched across the seat, likely imported from fringe worlds. The upholstery pressed up around Anton, gently folding as the taxi lifted off, accelerating towards the bypass – an expansive, serpentine maze of underpasses that would allow them to quickly traverse the city, avoiding the congestion of other airways.

more stuff to build the setting (I am quite lazy).

“Two millennia ago, the very land we stand on today was the fertile ground of Vēndrik Katvaya, the great Ecclesian capital: the epicenter of development and innovation. The Empire they had built stretched the far, forgotten corners of our star cluster; a conquest so marvelous in its scale as to dwarf even the greatest military feats of our time. Yet, I come before you today not to speak of the triumphs of our predecessors, but to speak to a necessity of the present: one which may decide the fate of our federation.

Ecclesia was a kingdom of conquest, and such was the cause of its demise. As we are now, it was threatened by seperatist nations which lay at the fringes of its civilization. For as mighty as Ecclesia was, it had one fault, one critical flaw: a propensity for conflict. And at a caucus - not unlike the one we are currently in attendance - they would concomitantly doom their empire and erect the foundations of our great republic. At this very moment, we are at a similar fulcrum in our history, a moment so very precious, one that must be treated with the upmost care; for currently, the Republic of Asplain is threatened by Kyōtian intervention: actions which could result in the dissolution of Asplain’s governmental structures and the loss of Asplain itself.

And yet, in the face of this looming threat, I propose the best course of action is inaction. Many would argue that this accomplishes nothing, that we must protect our territory and maintain the sovereignty of our lands – even now you may be deliberating this. By yielding, would we not be inviting the seizure of other border territories? But this is an unnecessary worry. The Kyōtians have no motivation to capture our outer planets; even now their government struggles to perpetuate their presence in frontier worlds. And so I ask; what benefit would they realize from the capture of desolate, barren planets? As such, I argue the loss of Asplain would be a trifling matter to our great democracy; Asplain has no natural resources , nor a great amount of arable land. In the face of such a conflict - one that could bring our republic to an end - we must tread lightly.”

“Thank you, Anton Haught.” 

Anton nodded and stepped back from the lectern, returning to his desk in the rear-most corner of the hall. Mikhael glanced over at him as he settled.

“Well they don’t look too happy.” 

“I’d imagine. Some of them are getting paid a lot of money to justify a war goal on Asplain.” Anton simpered, leaning back in his seat. “I’d imagine I’m being a large enough annoyance to disrupt it.”

“A speech probably isn’t going to do much.”

“Likely not, but I’d like to see them once they read the motion I submitted to the Appellate court. That should stop them from doing much.”

“You are aware they can just circumvent this by lending equipment, right?” Mikhael’s brow furrowed.

“I’m not trying to outright prevent war, I just want to ensure the FASS doesn’t mobilize. As long as the conflict is contained to Asplain, I don’t see why it would be an issue.”

“Right, right,” his gaze returned to the rostrum. “I just really dislike politics.”

“I grow tired of the meaningless banter too; they make decisions not for the good of our federation, but for the promise of profit. No one gets a seat except through nepotism – they’re clueless aristocrats.” Anton’s hands returned to his papers, shuffling them once more.

“Mr. Anton, questions, if you will,” a voice stated from the lectern, waiting for his attention.

“Yes, yes. . .” Anton responded, shifting straighter in his seat. “Apologies,”

“I wanted to inquire about several points you made during your speech. Primarily, why do you draw direct parallels between the fall of the Ecclesian empire and the peril that currently befalls our territory? They are quite different events, and by your own words the fall of the Ecclesian empire could be attributed to their ruthless expansionism.” The man stared at Anton.

“My purpose by recounting the fall of Ecclesia was not to directly compare the two events, it was simply to emphasize the danger of conflict. As I’m sure you well know, the fall of Ecclesia resulted not only in their downfall, but an economic recession that would nearly destroy the nation of KyōtoCorp. Conflict is detrimental to our society, whether or not we are willing participants.”

The man’s brows furrowed slightly. “Would you say then, that we are unwilling participants in this war?”

“I hardly suggested such a thing; as previously stated, Asplain is of minor importance, we have no need of it. Why defend such a desolate, infertile planet?” Adjusting nervously in his seat, Anton continued, “it has precious few resources left.”

“You say then that we have a choice in the matter, but then suggest the alternative is to allow Asplain to be captured?” The man stared accusingly at Anton, apparently disgusted by the proposition. “The preservation of the Republic of Asplain is more a matter of principle, not preservation. By allowing Kyōtian intervention to go unchallenged, we would demonstrate that our federation is incapable of defending our territory, and invite further attacks.”

“Perhaps, but you state that it is not a matter of preservation. What is it then? An attempt to project the strength of the FASS? To threaten and influence adjunct nations? Engaging in a costly, deadly war would cause more harm than anything else, both to our republic and the people of Asplain.” Anton slid his palms over his desk. “Nothing good would come of it.”

“The Republic of Asplain is not just a matter of strategic importance; it is also a matter of moral responsibility. As a member of the federation, we have a duty to defend our allies and uphold the principles of freedom and democracy.” The man’s hands splayed out in front of him, drumming the air to the rhythm of his words: “To stand idly by while Kyōtian forces annex Asplain would be to betray these principles and abandon our moral obligation to defend the innocent.”

Anton grunted quietly, glancing down at his papers. “While we do have an obligation to defend our territory and protect nations that cannot defend themselves, I do not believe this warrants the sacrifice of our society. If we allow the tides of war to run their course, I fear our civilization may be swept away.”

“So you suggest we abandon our allies for. . . what? Little more than a gut feeling? In that case, I believe our debate is concluded.”

The legislative chamber grew silent, save for the faint accompaniment of shuffling papers.

“Thank you – Haught, Kateb. Are there any more objections to be raised?” No one spoke. “As the floor is now concluded, we will begin the referendum for the following motion; the Alliance Defence Act. All in favor, please indicate on the ballot slip – objections can be submitted via the lower box. As this is a tenant vote, all in attendance must participate.
