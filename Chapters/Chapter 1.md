As the Ārakṣakayā coasted through the darkness of space, Captain Anton Chekhov felt the heady mix of fear and boredom familiar to every soldier on patrol. The ship had been assigned to the blockade at Asplain for a week now, without resupply. The crew were on their last legs; his weapons officer, Lieutenant Stefan Müller, sat dozing at his console, a cup of coffee cooling beside his drooping head. For a moment, Anton was tempted to chastise him, but thought better of it - everyone was exhausted.

Despite the monotonous dread and fatigue, Anton felt faintly elated. He finally had his own ship. Well, she wasn't really *his* ship; technically, she belonged to the noble citizens of the Free Asiaru Star Systems, whom he had sworn to protect. Still, as her captain and commanding officer, the Ārakṣakaya belonged to Anton in principle, and that was enough for him. Even now, he could recall the first time he saw her in that docking bay: her sleek radiators; her gleaming auto-cannons; her sizable sixteen-missile complement; her smooth, sensual...

A panel lit up, jerking Anton from his reverie, and he glanced over, flustered. The ship was receiving an incoming radio request. “Read the radio signature and identify the craft it's coming from." he snapped. "I figure if it was a military vessel they would have used private channels.”

*Damn civvies*, Anton thought. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Lt. Müller stirring groggily, and he had to bite his lip to keep from smirking.

The communications officer, Lt. Juliette Dubois, spoke from the rearmost console. “We were able to ID it with a commercial transmitting array. It matched it with fair accuracy against a civilian cargo vessel. Respond, sir?”

Anton nodded. The monitor glowed green as the ship returned the signal and began transmitting. “This is FASSS Ārakṣakayā,” Anton said. “Please state intent.”

The voice on the other end responded in slightly accented English: “Hello, this is Captain Tanaka of the exchange vessel C-87E45, the Sakurajima. We had a sudden drop in reactor power during warp, and lost our engines: we’re stranded and in need of aid. I’m requesting assistance for repairs.”

“Understood. Are you carrying sensitive cargo or weaponry?”

“Negative. Just food and supplies.”

Anton flicked the transmitter off and turned to Lt. Dubois. “Request orders from HQ. Give them our coordinates, and tell them we're talking to a blockade runner that got shot out of warp.”

Several seconds later, the communications officer replied over the intercom: “They’re processing our request.”

Anton cleared his throat, and flicked the transmitter back on, continuing: "Sakurajima, be advised that you were approaching an area of hostilities currently under blockade: Asplain and its orbital structures are closed to all traffic. We can send you a drone tender to assist with repairs, but we request that you leave this area once those repairs are concluded."

"Negative. Our destination is Asplain," came the reply.

Anton had to stop himself from slamming his fist against his desk. Instead, he put his feet up and settled back. "One moment," he said, turning the transmitter off. "Any response from HQ?"

Lt. Dubois turned towards him and nodded, her expression neutral. "They're recommending that we fire on them, sir"

Anton bolted upright. "Fire on them?!"

"Yes, sir."

Anton stood, mind racing. *It makes sense*, he thought. *The Sakurajima had transmitted on a public channel. Who knew who could have received it? Taisho ships could be en route as we speak. And for all we know, it's just as likely for the Sakurajima to be carrying potatoes as it is nukes.* "Can we board?" he wondered aloud.

Even as he said it, Anton knew it was impossible. *Of course we can't board. First of all, there's not enough time to reach them, and even if there was, there's no telling whether they'd resist or not. We don't even have a marine detachment. The last thing I need is an hours-long siege on my hands.*
