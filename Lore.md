# Free Asiaru Star Systems:

FASS is a flawed democracy, aristocratic, elitist in politics, outdated power structures. Possibly on the brink of splitting into a couple smaller nations, so it uses the war to try and unify the nation. Perhaps one nation is thinking of splitting, and wants to expand their power before they do?

Another reason they would use mercenaries beside trying to avoid direct participation in the war is because their democracy is somewhat inefficient? They struggle to mobilize an army. Somewhere between austria-hungary and articles of confederation.

English is a common language, generally everyone has at least a basic understanding of it. Ecclesia is the predecessor to the modern FASS. Prior to the fall of the Ecclesian empire, Ecclesia attempted to aggressively expand their influence, and conquer neighbouring nations. Eventually, this lead to their demise due to political dissent and the war turning against their favor. A new empire would conquer the core planets, and begin calling themselves the new Ecclesia. In their language, they called themselves As’scliesa. As their influence began to expand, they would form several government bodies to regulate each nations actions with regard to the others. As the nations began to unify further, they began referring to themselves as ‘As’sieru,’ which would eventually form into the Free Asiaru Star Systems.
## FASS Ship Classification:

Named after old Ecclesian Empire provinces. Ecclesian empire was one the predecessor kingdoms to the FASS.

There are 4 classes of ships as designated by FORCOM (Asiarian Force Command) regulations – Class 0 through 3.
Class 0 represents a civilian retrofit of a ship designed for usage in transportation or shipping. Typically, only old, antiquated military vessels will be retrofitted to Class 0.
Class 1 are ships sold to privsec (private security) and private companies, and typically have lighter armaments and gutted electronic systems.
Class 2 are military exports sold to adjunct nations under the Free Asiaru Star System. They are military grade, though typically lack the most advanced technology.
Class 3 are state of the art military-grade ships designed for FASS usage.

# Kyōtocorp:

The Kyōtian empire used to be a small kingdom on the outskirts of the captured Ecclesian territory; however, when the star cluster of Ecclesian times collided with another open cluster, they were able to greatly expand their territory. After the fall of Ecclesia and expansion of the New Ecclesian Empire, several provinces would split into independent territories. While some were acquisent about joining the Kyōtian Empire, others tried to unsuccessfully fight for their independence. Of these, only one was able to maintain their independence from Kyōtocorp - Lieŭstva. However, due to increased tensions between the FASS and Kyōtian Empire, they have become more congenial with the Kyōtian Empire.

Kyōtocorp is a Japanese company founded long ago, Kyōtians, where Corp is a long lost appendum. It is now considered part of the Kyōtians name.
