## Political Structure
The Taisho Empire is an corporate oligarchy, where decisions are made by a board of directors of the company's major shareholders; however, as most major shareholders are members of the corporation's founding families, the Empire can also be classified as a sort of hereditary aristocracy. The board of directors serve as electors for the Taisho Emperor, who executes their will and can be replaced at any time. The system is still somewhat meritocratic, however, as influence within the empire is determined largely by percentage share in the corporation; a  citizen can purchase more shares, or acquire them through meritorious service.
## Language
Japanese is the primary language of the Taisho Empire, preserved in its old-Earth form by the empire's long period of isolation.
## History
The Taisho Empire was born of the old-Earth corporation Taisho Heavy Industries Ltd., an off-world mining, shipbuilding, and colonization company. After discovering the resource-rich planet of ÅŒkuninushi, the corporation cut off ties from its Earth-based shareholders and developed in relative isolation, eventually colonizing the entire Taisho sector; during this time, the corporation developed into an oligarchy ruled by members of the company's founding families. Upon the collapse of the dominant [[Ecclesian Empire]], the Taisho Empire emerged into the universe as a powerful force, contesting the FASS for control over the core worlds.
