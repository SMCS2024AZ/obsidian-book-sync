## Political Structure
The FASS is a flawed democracy: aristocratic, politically elitist, and rife with outdated power structures.

## Language
English is the common language of the FASS, and nearly everyone has a basic understanding of it.

## History
The FASS was preceded by the [[Ecclesian Empire]]. Prior to its fall, the Ecclesian Empire attempted to aggressively expand its influence and conquer neighboring nations. Eventually, the war turned against them and led to mass political dissent, resulting in their demise. A new empire would conquer the core worlds, calling themselves New Ecclesia (in their language, they called themselves As’scliesa). As their influence began to expand, they would form a central regulatory body governing the surrounding states, incorporating new states with a mixture of diplomacy and coercion. This loose confederation of states began referring to themselves as ‘As’sieru,’ which would eventually form into the Free Asiaru Star Systems.

### Navy
There are 4 classes of ships as designated by FORCOM (Asiarian Force Command) regulations:
* Class 0 represents a civilian retrofit of a ship designed for usage in transportation or shipping. Typically, only old, antiquated military vessels will be retrofitted to Class 0.
* Class 1 are ships sold to privsec (private security) and private companies, and typically have lighter armaments and gutted electronic systems.
* Class 2 are military exports sold to adjunct nations under the Free Asiaru Star System. They are military grade, though typically lack the most advanced technology.
* Class 3 are state of the art military-grade ships designed for FASS naval usage.
